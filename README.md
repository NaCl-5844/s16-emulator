# s16-emulator

Simple-16 is a simple ISA with a 16-bit data width. The aim for this repo is to design and test out ways to make a low level emulation of a CPU.

Main Goals:
  - Configurable main memory size and speed
  - Configurable cache size and replacement algorithm
  - Output a file containing changes in memory and functional units each cycle
