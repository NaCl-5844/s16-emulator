Some may ask "why make a digram/table in a .txt?", which is quite reasonable, but please understand that I've tried using other methods with minimal success.

First, I used brainstorming apps which could output to .svg, a vector graphics file which can scale really nicely at any zoom. This worked fine until
you needed to write a lot of text with whatever diagram you're making, and would almost always find a way to break unless you:
    - babysit the text to make sure it didn't clip into the diagram or table
    - export, check for clipping, reformat the text, export... Just to make sure the text properly displayed
This is the case for both the ones I used on mobile and desktop. There's still general vector graphics, however manually making tables, arrows, text boxes, etc
seems way too annoying. So if I need to do everything manually anyway, using a .txt file and being able to align text, make tables and have the option to
convert it to .md files in the future is worth the effort to me.

So here we are, in a .txt file >_>. I hope you can understand the diagrams and can follow along with the brainstorm.
As always: these diagrams can be misleading or completely wrong, nevertheless feel free to use or share them.
