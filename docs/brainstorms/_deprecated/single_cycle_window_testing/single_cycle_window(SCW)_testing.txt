[ SINGLE CYCLE WINDOW MICRO-ARCHITECTURE TESTING ]


PREFACE

Brainstorm/Stress test aims:
  - Test if dependancies consistently stall temporally across mutliple depedant instructions
  - Find and fix shortcomings in the micro-architecture
  - Determine how flags should effect the dependancy matrix
  - Find out if more flags are required

Note that the program used isn't a worst case, nor very creative. The program's purpose is
to test the dependancy matrix over a program large enough to fully saturate it and spot any
issues which need addressing.




CHANGELOG

As I work through the test I will add a log of changes/features added to the design:

  - when an instruction issues, after first unary count decrement, the read operands are
    clearned.
  - When an instruction writes back(unary count=0), the write operand is cleared
  - WAW should be tested further as this dependancy seems like it could be missed,
  - Branch predictions, BTB predictions, must keep the predictive instruction in the
    dep. matrix until resolved. If mis predicted, all instructions after prediction
    is set to invalid. Hence predictive instructions would technically reuse
    asynchronous logic and use the asy flag.


  > Additional flags required:
    (May or may not update all tables as they're added)

    - isu [issue], raised upon first decrement of unary count
    - asy [asynchronous], raised for instructions which wait for asynchronous
      acknowledgements to complete
    - inv [invalid], raised on mispredicted instruction branches.


  > Additional hardware required:
    - Provisioning hardware to choose which hardware operand/bus is read to for single
      operand instructions

( test program )


fib and divide output by bit count {

  clr r0, r15 ; priority instruction, will force all flags to true. clr generates no operands
  lim r0, 1
  bc r2, r0 ; cost=2 cycles
  add r1, r1, r0
  bc r3, r1
  div r2, r0 ; cost=4 cycles
  div r3, r1
  add r0, r1, r0

  }

unrolled once so program can saturate dep. matrix {
