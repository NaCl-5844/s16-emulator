[ SINGLE CYCLE WINDOW MICRO-ARCHITECTURE TESTING ]


<PREFACE>

Brainstorm/Stress test aims:
  - Test if dependancies consistently stall temporally across mutliple depedant instructions
  - Find shortcomings in the micro-architecture
  - Determine how flags should effect the dependancy matrix
  - Find out if more flags are required

NOTE

The program used isn't a worst case, nor very creative. The program's purpose is to test the
dependancy matrix over a program large enough to fully saturate it and to have a closer look
at dependancy management.

</PREFACE>


CHANGELOG / CONCLUSIONS

As I work through the test I will add a log of changes/features added to the design:

  - when an instruction issues, after first unary count decrement, the read operands are
    clearned.
  - When an instruction writes back(unary count=0), the write operand is cleared

  - WAW should be tested further as this dependancy seems like it could be missed,



  > Additional flags required:
    (I may update all tables as they're added)

    - isu [issue] flag, raised upon first decrement of unary count
    - asy [asynchronous] flag, will be helpful whenn brainstorming the functionality of
      memory instructions.  No need to add in this bbrainstorm.



  > Additional hardware reqired:
    - Provisioning hardware to choose which hardware operand/bus is read to for single
      operand instructions
